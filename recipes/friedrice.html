<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Yangzhou fried rice is a popular Chinese wok-style fired rice dish. Commonly
  sold outside of China as â€œhouse special fried rice. The main difference in
  Yangzhou fried rice is the use of a combination of proteins. Rather than using
  a single protein like shrimp or pork or chicken as the dominant ingredient,
  Yangzhou uses a variety. Most common combination is pork, shrimp and
  frequently chicken or duck.
