    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Gyudon, is a Japanese dish consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef
      and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi (fish and
      seaweed stock), soy sauce and mirin (sweet rice wine). It may sometimes
      also be served with toppings such as raw or soft poached eggs, Welsh
      onions (negi), grated cheese or kimchi. A popular food in Japan, it is
      commonly eaten with beni sh≈çga (pickled ginger), shichimi (ground chili
      pepper), and a side dish of miso soup.
