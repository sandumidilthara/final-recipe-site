    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Taco rice is a popular example of Okinawan cuisine. It consists of
      taco-flavored ground beef served on a bed of rice. Frequently served with
      shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa. It's one of the best-known
      dishes of Okinawan cuisine outside of Okinawa. Taco rice is a popular dish
      among U.S. military personnel stationed in Okinawa as lunch or late night
      bar food.
